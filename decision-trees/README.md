# Decision Trees

An introductory example of decision trees using data from this [interactive visualization](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/).

For an implementation working with the same data in R, see [here](https://github.com/INFO-201/m15-special-topics/tree/master/exercise-2).

Approach based largely on the [scikit learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html).
