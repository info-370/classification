    "It is common to compare the _true positive rate_ (sensitivity) to the _false positive rate_ (1 - specificity) at each **threshold** for classification in an [ROC Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic). This [interactive visualization](http://www.navan.name/roc/) may help you better understand the relationship between thresholds and the ROC. In this section, you'll do the following:\n",
